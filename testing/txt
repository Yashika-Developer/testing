Yes, you will need to create the project structure manually. Here's a detailed guide on how to do it using VS Code:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Manually Create the Project Structure

#### 1. Open VS Code and Create a New Project Directory

1. Open VS Code.
2. Open the integrated terminal (View > Terminal).
3. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

```sh
cd path/to/your/directory
```

4. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```sh
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
```

#### 2. Create the Project Structure

1. Create the `features` directory and its subdirectories:

```sh
mkdir -p features/steps
```

2. Create the `example.feature` file:

```sh
code features/example.feature
```

Add the following content to `example.feature`:

```gherkin
Feature: Example feature
  Scenario: Example scenario
    Given I open the browser
    When I go to the Google homepage
    Then the title should be "Google"
```

3. Create the `steps.py` file:

```sh
code features/steps/steps.py
```

Add the following content to `steps.py`:

```python
from behave import given, when, then
from selenium import webdriver

@given('I open the browser')
def step_impl(context):
    context.browser = webdriver.Chrome()

@when('I go to the Google homepage')
def step_impl(context):
    context.browser.get('https://www.google.com')

@then('the title should be "Google"')
def step_impl(context):
    assert context.browser.title == "Google"
    context.browser.quit()
```

4. Create the `environment.py` file:

```sh
code features/environment.py
```

Add the following content to `environment.py` (optional):

```python
from selenium import webdriver

def before_all(context):
    context.browser = webdriver.Chrome()

def after_all(context):
    if hasattr(context, 'browser'):
        context.browser.quit()

```

5. Create the `behave.ini` file (optional):

```sh
code behave.ini
```

Add the following content to `behave.ini`:

```ini
[behave]
default_tags = ~@wip
```

#### 3. Install Required Packages

Make sure you have `behave` and `selenium` installed. If not, install them using pip:

```sh
pip install behave selenium
```

#### 4. WebDriver Setup

Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., `chromedriver` for Chrome) and place it in a directory included in your system's PATH. Alternatively, specify its path directly in your script:

```python
context.browser = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='/path/to/chromedriver')
```

#### 5. Run Your Tests

To run your tests, navigate to your project directory in the terminal and execute:

```sh
behave
```

This command will look for feature files in the `features` directory and run the tests according to the step definitions provided.

### Additional Tips

- **Python Interpreter**: Ensure that VS Code is using the correct Python interpreter. You can select the interpreter by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` and typing "Python: Select Interpreter".
- **Linting and Formatting**: Install and configure Python linting and formatting extensions in VS Code to improve code quality and readability.
- **Integrated Terminal**: Use the integrated terminal in VS Code for running commands and viewing outputs.

By following these steps, you'll manually set up the project structure required for `behave` and Selenium in Python, and be able to run your BDD tests using VS Code.
